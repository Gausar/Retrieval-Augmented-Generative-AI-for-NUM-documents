## The aim of this research work is to apply the RAG method to Mongolian language data and explore ways to improve its results.
Sharing our results:
1. First of all, the data processing needs to be good. Also, all the prepared data is included here. I thought that there must have been a lot of errors because I had edited my data from an image extension to a text file. After that, I concluded that the final result was not good either. However, this RAG method has given very good results for small data.
